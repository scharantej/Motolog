 ## Flask Application Design for Maintenance Records App

### HTML Files

#### `index.html`
- This is the main HTML file that serves as the entry point for the application.
- It contains the user interface elements, such as forms for adding and viewing maintenance records.
- It also includes the necessary HTML structure and styling.

#### `add_record.html`
- This HTML file is used for adding new maintenance records to the database.
- It contains a form with fields for entering information such as engine hours, service type, and date.

#### `view_records.html`
- This HTML file is used for viewing the existing maintenance records.
- It displays a table with columns for engine hours, service type, date, and other relevant information.

### Routes

#### `/`
- This route handles the main page of the application.
- It renders the `index.html` file, which displays the user interface for adding and viewing maintenance records.

#### `/add_record`
- This route handles the submission of new maintenance records.
- It receives the data from the `add_record.html` form and saves it to the database.
- After successful submission, it redirects the user to the main page (`/`).

#### `/view_records`
- This route handles the request to view the existing maintenance records.
- It retrieves the records from the database and renders the `view_records.html` file, which displays the records in a table.

### Additional Considerations

- The application should use a database to store the maintenance records.
- The application should implement appropriate security measures to protect the data.
- The application should be tested thoroughly to ensure its functionality and reliability.
